      "description": "Allows commands to be associated with keystrokes in a\ncontext-sensitive way. In Atom, you can access a global instance of this\nobject via `atom.keymap`.\n\nKey bindings are plain JavaScript objects containing **CSS selectors** as\ntheir top level keys, then **keystroke patterns** mapped to commands.\n\n```cson\n'.workspace':\n  'ctrl-l': 'package:do-something'\n  'ctrl-z': 'package:do-something-else'\n'.mini.editor':\n  'enter': 'core:confirm'\n```\n\nWhen a keystroke sequence matches a binding in a given context, a custom DOM\nevent with a type based on the command is dispatched on the target of the\nkeyboard event.\n\nTo match a keystroke sequence, the keymap starts at the target element for the\nkeyboard event. It looks for key bindings associated with selectors that match\nthe target element. If multiple match, the most specific is selected. If there\nis a tie in specificity, the most recently added binding wins. If no bindings\nare found for the events target, the search is repeated again for the target's\nparent node and so on recursively until a binding is found or we traverse off\nthe top of the document.\n\nWhen a binding is found, its command event is always dispatched on the\noriginal target of the keyboard event, even if the matching element is higher\nup in the DOM. In addition, `.preventDefault()` is called on the keyboard\nevent to prevent the browser from taking action. `.preventDefault` is only\ncalled if a matching binding is found.\n\nCommand event objects have a non-standard method called `.abortKeyBinding()`.\nIf your command handler is invoked but you programmatically determine that no\naction can be taken and you want to allow other bindings to be matched, call\n`.abortKeyBinding()` on the event object. An example of where this is useful\nis binding snippet expansion to `tab`. If `snippets:expand` is invoked when\nthe cursor does not follow a valid snippet prefix, we abort the binding and\nallow `tab` to be handled by the default handler, which inserts whitespace.\n\nMulti-keystroke bindings are possible. If a sequence of one or more keystrokes\n*partially* matches a multi-keystroke binding, the keymap enters a pending\nstate. The pending state is terminated on the next keystroke, or after\n{::partialMatchTimeout} milliseconds has elapsed. When the pending state is\nterminated via a timeout or a keystroke that leads to no matches, the longest\nambiguous bindings that caused the pending state are temporarily disabled and\nthe previous keystrokes are replayed. If there is ambiguity again during the\nreplay, the next longest bindings are disabled and the keystrokes are replayed\nagain. "
